ccminer-solo-zcc
================

`./ccminer -a zcc -o 127.0.0.1:7888 -u <rpcuser> -p <rpcpassword> --coinbase-addr=<zcoin-classic-address>`

 - rpcuser: same as rpcuser in $HOME/.zcc/zcc.conf (or windows equivalent)
 - rpcpassword: same as rpcpassword in $HOME/.zcc/zcc.conf (or windows equivalent)
 - zcoin-classic-address: wallet address you want block reward sent to



ccsolominer
===========

Based on Christian Buchner's &amp; Christian H.'s CUDA project, no more active on github recently.

ccsolominer is a merge of the current version of ccminer and the older nanashi solo fork. This brings optimized kernels and newer algorithms to a solo miner, while still having the same features as the current version.

find a fork of ccminer with better performance or new algorithms? open an issue or pull request and I will add them in

Fork by tpruvot@github with X14,X15,X17,Blake256,BlakeCoin,Lyra2RE,Skein,ZR5 and others, check the [README.txt](README.txt)

A part of the recent algos were originally written by [djm34](https://github.com/djm34) and [alexis78](https://github.com/alexis78).

This variant was tested and built on Linux (ubuntu server 14.04) and VStudio 2013 on Windows 7.

Note that the x86 releases are generally faster than x64 ones on Windows.

The required CUDA Toolkit version is [9.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

About source code dependencies
------------------------------

This project requires some libraries to be built :

- OpenSSL (prebuilt for win)

- Curl (prebuilt for win)

- pthreads (prebuilt for win)

The tree now contains recent prebuilt openssl and curl .lib for both x86 and x64 platforms (windows).

To rebuild them, you need to clone this repository and its submodules :
    git clone https://github.com/peters/curl-for-windows.git compat/curl-for-windows

On Linux, you can use the helper ./build.sh (edit it if required)

There is also an old [Tutorial for windows](http://cudamining.co.uk/url/tutorials/id/3) on [CudaMining](http://cudamining.co.uk) website.
